Then, however, the preanalyzed\n        data format cannot be used because this is the format that required the ElasticSearch plugin.\n    ","group":"general","module":{"type":"GitHubRepository","name":"jcore-projects","version":"v2.4","updateable":true,"gitHubName":"JULIELab"},"base":null,"exposable":true,"categories":["consumer"],"name":"JCoRe ElasticSearch Consumer","pear":false,"base-project":null,"maven-artifact":{"groupId":"de.julielab","artifactId":"jcore-elasticsearch-consumer","version":"2.4.0-SNAPSHOT","classifier":null,"file":"/home/faessler/.m2/repository/de/julielab/jcore-elasticsearch-consumer/2.4.0-SNAPSHOT/jcore-elasticsearch-consumer-2.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar","packaging":"jar"}},"name":"JCoRe ElasticSearch Consumer","active":true}]
